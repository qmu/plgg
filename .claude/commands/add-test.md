- Add spec.ts for `$ARGUMENT`
- When the comment above is "Add spec.ts for ``", the user did not provide a specific argument, so you ask the user to provide one.
- User only `test` (not `describe`, `it`, etc.) in the spec.ts file.
- Use `expect` and `assert` for assertions.
- No relative imports, use absolute imports.
- Make sure `npm run coverage` passes and 100% for both C1 and C2, but least tests.
