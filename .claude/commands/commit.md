- After reviewing staged changes, write a clear and complete title starting with a present-tense verb like Add, Modify, or Fix.
- Only commit staged changes without adding new files.
- If unrelated changes are included, end with "etc."
- In the body, summarize the changes as bullet points.
- Focus on "why" the developer made this change, not just "what" changed. This context is essential for generating meaningful CHANGELOGs later. Include the motivation, problem being solved, or benefit gained.
